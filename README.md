2023/04/15

## This is the Readme file for our statistic research project.

As mentioned in the title, this is the detailed information for our applications for the Multisample cross-match test and Graph-based Feature Selection method. The whole file can be divided into four parts. First one is the introduction for our basic methedology and theories. Second part is our own simulation about MMCM test and GFS method. The last two parts are basicly the applications on real-life datasets, one is Mice protein dataset, the other one is the Brain cancer dataset.

TBD for more details.....
